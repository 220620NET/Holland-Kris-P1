/* Menu Class

    This is how I see the user actually using this system
    First Screen:
        There will be an option to login, register or exit in the first screen
            If logging in
                The user will enter a username and password.
                    This will check if the username has been registered and if it hasn't will tell the user that the username doesn't exist in the system
                This screen will then send the user to a screen to manage tickets
            If Registering:
